Explosions are marked with '>'. Immediately after the mark, there will be an integer x,
which signifies the strength of the explosion.
You should remove x characters, starting after the punch character ('>').
If you find another explosion mark ('>') while you are deleting characters,
you should add the strength to your previous explosion.
You should not delete the explosion character â€“ '>'.
When all characters are processed, print the final string.
