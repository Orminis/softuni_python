"""
Write a program which finds how many times a given word is used in each sentence.
Note that letter case does not matter â€“ it is case-insensitive.
The output is a single number indicating the number of times the sentence contains the word.
Example:
    The waterfall was so high, that the child couldn't see its peak.
    the
Output:
    2
